# lowcarbonresearchmethods
An energy efficient design for the website of the Low Carbon Research Methods group


## To do
* layout resizing
	* links at top of resources page
	* header text
* documentation
* color theme switching 
* adding page size data info
* integrated 2021 lecture series page into new site
* avoiding video autoplay
* in regards to the circular logo shape: it looks like it cuts a little too close to the S in methods---could the text be shrunk a bit, or the circle expanded?
